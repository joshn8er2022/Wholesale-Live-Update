# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide

## Fix for 404 NOT_FOUND Error

The 404 error you encountered was due to the project structure having the Next.js app in a subdirectory. This has now been **fixed**!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

- ✅ **Project Restructured**: Moved Next.js app from `app/` subdirectory to root level
- ✅ **Vercel Detection**: Now properly detects as Next.js application
- ✅ **Build Configuration**: All config files in correct locations
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Secure credential handling maintained

## 🔄 Redeploy Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Redeployment (Recommended)

Since your GitHub repository is already connected to Vercel:

1. **Vercel will automatically detect the changes** and redeploy
2. **Check your Vercel dashboard** - you should see a new deployment in progress
3. **Wait for deployment** - it should now build successfully!

### Option 2: Manual Trigger

If automatic deployment doesn't start:

1. Go to your **Vercel Dashboard**
2. Find your **Wholesale-Live-Update** project
3. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
4. Or push any small change to trigger new build

### Option 3: Fresh Connection

If you want to start fresh:

1. **Delete the existing Vercel project**
2. **Import the repository again** from GitHub
3. Vercel will now detect it properly as Next.js

## ⚙️ Environment Variables Setup

Don't forget to add your environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add these variables:
   - `SHOPIFY_STORE_URL` = `https://your-store.myshopify.com`
   - `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` = `your_shopify_access_token_here`

**Note**: Use your actual Shopify store URL and access token from your original setup.

## ✨ Expected Result

After redeployment, your app should:
- ✅ Build successfully without errors
- ✅ Display the luxury inventory tracker interface
- ✅ Connect to your Shopify store properly
- ✅ Show product search and inventory data

## 🔍 Verification

Once deployed, test these features:
1. **Homepage loads** without 404 error
2. **Search functionality** works
3. **Product data** displays from your Shopify store
4. **Inventory levels** show correctly with color indicators

## 🆘 If Still Issues

If you still encounter problems:
1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your Shopify API token has proper permissions
